# Dr.-Hero
Dr.-Hero is a working title for a 2D action-game made with Unity3D. The game will feature randomly generated levels with multiple randomly generated rooms with one big bossfight at the end of each level. 

By killing a boss, of simply by killing enemys across levels, you can gain EXP to level up your character and earn skillpoints for one of two skilltrees (Ranged
or Meleecombat). 

The player can swap between two shapes, Melee or Ranged, to react to different situations.
